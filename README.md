## What is Git Workflow?
Git Workflow design showcases a bracing model designed around the project. This provides a robust framework for a collaborate team to follow.

###Repository: 
tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.

###Clone:
A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.

###Fork:
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Fork allows you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.

###Branch:
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.
